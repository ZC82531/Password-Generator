# Password Generator

Created by: Zakaria Chowdhury

The following can be done:

* The generator allows you to check categories of what elements should be in the generated password. By default, everything will be included
* The length of the password can be chosen. It has current bounds of 4 to 30 inclusive, but can be adjusted in index.html under the ID "number".
